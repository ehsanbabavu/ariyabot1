# Overview

This project is a modern, full-stack TypeScript Persian e-commerce and support web application. It offers comprehensive features including user management, a ticketing system, inventory, and subscription services with role-based access control. The platform is designed for the Persian market, featuring a fully localized Farsi UI, responsive design, and AI-powered functionalities like smart ordering and WhatsApp-based deposit receipt processing. The ambition is to provide an intuitive and powerful online business tool, enhancing user experience through advanced AI and robust system architecture.

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **Components & Styling**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI-based) and Tailwind CSS, with Vazirmatn font for Persian script and RTL support.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design featuring a hamburger menu and drawer for mobile navigation, and a fixed sidebar for desktop.
- **Design Elements**: Compact card layouts, auto-sliding carousels, dynamic notifications, and Persian invoice templates with currency conversion.

## Technical Implementations
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, and ES modules.
- **API**: RESTful, JSON-based.
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt hashing and role-based access control (admin, user_level_1, user_level_2).
- **File Management**: Multer for uploads, local storage for images, Puppeteer for HTML-to-image invoice generation.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, Neon Database for serverless hosting, Drizzle Kit for migrations, and connect-pg-simple for session storage.

## Feature Specifications
- **WhatsApp Integration**: AI-powered OCR for deposit receipts (Gemini Vision), smart product ordering, duplicate transaction detection, automated notifications, and invoice delivery. Includes an intelligent, rate-limited queue system (3 messages/sec per user) with retries to prevent API blocking.
- **Internal Chat**: Real-time unread message badges with role-based visibility.
- **Order Management**: Enhanced order display for sellers, new order notifications, unshipped orders dashboard, and automatic invoice generation.
- **Transaction Management**: Duplicate transaction detection and automated WhatsApp notifications for approval/rejection.
- **Shipping Management**: Configurable shipping methods (Pishaz, Ordinary, Courier, Free) for sellers, with buyer selection during checkout.
- **VAT Management**: Seller-configurable Value Added Tax (VAT) with customizable percentage, enable/disable toggle, and invoice thank you message. VAT calculation is integrated into order totals and displayed separately on invoices.
- **Password Reset**: Secure OTP-based recovery via WhatsApp with rate limiting.
- **Cart Page Redesign**: Responsive two-column layout showing product details on the right and order summary, delivery, and shipping options on the left.
- **Automatic Order Processing**: Upon deposit transaction approval, the system automatically processes pending orders chronologically, confirming them, deducting payment, and updating balances until funds are insufficient.
- **Database Backup & Restore**: Complete database backup and restore system for admin users with:
  - Full PostgreSQL backup creation using pg_dump with automatic download
  - Restore from SQL backup files with psql
  - List of saved backups with file size and creation date
  - Download individual backup files
  - Delete old backup files
  - Path traversal protection with filename validation and directory containment checks
  - Admin-only access with JWT authentication
  - Persian UI accessible at /database-backup in admin settings menu

## System Design Choices
- **AI Architecture**: Dual AI provider system supporting Gemini AI (Google) and Liara AI (OpenAI-compatible) with an AI Service Orchestrator for centralized management and automatic failover. Only one provider is active at a time, configurable via admin settings.
- **Development & Deployment**: Vite for frontend bundling and development server; Express serves static assets in production. Configured for VM deployment.
- **Security**: JWT_SECRET and ADMIN_PASSWORD managed via Replit Secrets.
